# Healthcare Data Lifecycle - Mini Project

This repository maps a healthcare data lifecycle (capture -> store -> process -> visualize).
It contains synthetic sample data and a small script to help you prepare your assignment.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open Power BI Desktop -> Get Data -> CSV -> import files from `data/`.
3. Use Power Query to clean and transform (types, missing values).
4. Build visuals: KPI cards (Total Patients, Appointments, Revenue), charts (Appointments by Dept, Top Doctors, Billing summary).
5. Export screenshots to /images/ and include them in your assignment PDF.

Add your name and enrollment number to this README and to your assignment PDF.
